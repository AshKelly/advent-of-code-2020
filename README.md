This a repo to house my [AoC20](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in C++.

This year Iâ€™ve decided to blog every day; these posts will include my initial thoughts, the code I implemented and then my reflections. As my goal for Advent of Code is to become a better programmer, my reflections generally involve me asking myself some questions:

    Was the algorithm I implemented optimal? If not, why and how could I improve it?

Regardless of the outcome of these questions, I then ask a final question:

    Did I implement the algorithm in an efficient and readable way?
