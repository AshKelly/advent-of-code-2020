This a repo to house my [AoC20](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in C++.

This year Iâ€™ve decided to blog every day; these posts will include my initial thoughts, the code I implemented and then my reflections. As my goal for Advent of Code is to become a better programmer, my reflections generally involve me asking myself some questions:

    Was the algorithm I implemented optimal? If not, why and how could I improve it?

Regardless of the outcome of these questions, I then ask a final question:

    Did I implement the algorithm in an efficient and readable way?


# Running the code

First of all, enter the lib directory and run `make`. This just pre-compiles the
standard library headers, and pushes compilation time down.

You can then run `make` in any of the day folders to compile the solution. The
solution will compile without pre-compiling the headers.
